# Interstellar Time Dilation Explorer Textures

This directory contains texture files needed for the 3D models:

- `earth-map.jpg` - Earth surface texture (diffuse map)
- `earth-normal.jpg` - Earth normal map for surface details
- `earth-specular.jpg` - Earth specular map for shininess
- `earth-clouds.png` - Earth clouds layer (transparent)
- `earth-night.jpg` - Earth night lights
- `miller-map.jpg` - Miller's planet water world texture (shallow ocean with sandy bottom)

Please ensure these files are placed in the `/public` folder for the application to load them correctly.

## Recommended Texture Sources

You can download free planet textures from:
- NASA Visible Earth: https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/
- Solar System Scope: https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/
- Planet Texture Maps: https://planetpixelemporium.com/planets.html

For Miller's planet from Interstellar, you should use a texture that shows a shallow ocean water world with a visible sandy/rocky bottom, as depicted in the film.

## Miller's Planet Appearance in Interstellar

In the film, Miller's planet is characterized by:
1. A shallow ocean covering the entire planet surface (only a few feet deep)
2. Massive tidal waves caused by the gravitational pull of the nearby black hole Gargantua
3. A generally flat topography with no significant landmasses
4. A light blue/gray water color palette

The texture should reflect these characteristics, particularly the shallow water appearance.
